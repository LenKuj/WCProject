                  Check the times of the Magic Fountain sound and light shows.
                   This unique water and light feature receives 2.5 million visitors every year and is an 
                   internationally recognised emblem of our city.
                  The Magic Fountain can produce around 7 billion light-and-water combinations by
                   combining the hydraulic features 
                  and lighting it is equipped with.
                   Check out the sequences programmed for the fountain.
                   Located between the Palau Nacional and Avinguda de la Reina Maria Cristina it was built for the 1929 Universal Exposition by the engineer Carles Buïgas. 
                   It was not until the 1980s that it incorporated music, and for the Barcelona ’92 Olympic Games it was completely restored.
                    In recent years, the fountain has committed to sustainability, replacing its classic lighting with LED technology 
                    and incorporating the use of phreatic water.

                A prominent hill overlooking Barcelona and boasting fantastic city views,
                 Montjuïc mountain is very popular with tourists, especially since the surrounding area 
                 offers much to see and do in itself. It’s certainly recommended to get involved and lost
                  in the bustling streets of the city below, exploring everything there is to see and do, 
                  but to truly appreciate the size and splendour of Barcelona, you must take a trip up to the top. 
                  Take a moment of peace and tranquillity to admire exactly what you have been exploring, or will get to explore, 
                  on your trip to this fabulous city.

                A beautiful backdrop to the famous Plaça d’Espanya, Palau Nacional also goes by the name of National Art Museum
                 of Catalonia, and showcases the largest collection of Catalan art in the world. This spectacular building is
                  worth a visit even to admire from the outside. Built in 1929 for the International Exhibition, Palau Nacional 
                  has played host to prestigious events, including the opening ceremony of the Exhibition which was attended by
                   royalty. Nowadays, the inside of the building is home not only to Catalonian art, but Romanesque art, 
                   Gothic Art, Renaissance art, and modern art, and is definitely worth an explore.

              Possibly even more exciting than the views themselves is the Montjuïc cable car, 
              which takes visitors directly to the top of the city in the most entertaining and mind-blowing way possible.
              The Montjuïc cable car gives visitors the chance to sit in a cabin which can hold up to 8 people,
          and admire the panoramic views of the city. An ideal way to reach the top where there are attractions 
          to see and views to admire, and far more comfortable than hiking the steep route up. 
          Hop on the attractive cable car and glide above the tree tops for just over €10 for a return ticket.
